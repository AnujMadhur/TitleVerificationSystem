# **Title Verification System**

## **Abstract**

The Title Verification System ensures the uniqueness of newspaper titles by comparing them against a database of 160,000 existing titles. Using phonetic similarity algorithms, prefix/suffix handling, and guideline enforcement, the system efficiently identifies duplicate or misleading titles. Additionally, it provides a probability score for verification.
