Title Verification System - Week 2 Progress


Overview

In Week 2, we focused on deep cleaning and verifying the dataset to ensure accuracy and consistency. This involved detecting and removing special characters, handling missing values, and eliminating duplicate entries in both English and Hindi titles. The goal was to achieve a fully cleaned dataset for further processing in upcoming phases.

Data Cleaning & Verification
âœ… 1. Special Character Removal
Identified and removed unwanted special characters to ensure only valid English and Hindi text in titles.
âœ… 2. Handling Missing Values
Detected and addressed missing values in the Cleaned Hindi Title column.
Replaced missing values with appropriate placeholders to maintain data integrity.
âœ… 3. Duplicate Entry Removal
Identified and removed duplicate records in both English and Hindi titles.
Ensured each title appears only once in the cleaned dataset.
Final Dataset Verification
After completing the cleaning process, we performed a final quality check to confirm:

âœ” No missing values in any column.
âœ” No duplicate entries in English or Hindi titles.
âœ” No special characters or formatting issues.
âœ” Uniform formatting across all records.
âœ” Dataset is fully cleaned and ready for use. âœ…

Summary of Week 2 Achievements
âœ” Special characters removed.
âœ” Missing values handled.
âœ” Duplicate titles eliminated.
âœ” Final dataset verified and confirmed clean.

Next Steps (Week 3 and Beyond)
In the upcoming weeks, we will:

ðŸ”¹ Implement advanced text normalization techniques to enhance consistency.
ðŸ”¹ Develop title similarity detection using TF-IDF, Cosine Similarity, and phonetic matching.
ðŸ”¹ Begin API and frontend development for the system.
ðŸ”¹ Further refine the dataset based on domain-specific requirements.

With a fully cleaned and structured dataset, we are now well-prepared to move forward with model development!
