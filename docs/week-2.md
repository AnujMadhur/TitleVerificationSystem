# Title Verification System - Week 2 Progress  

## Overview  
In Week 2, we focused on deep cleaning and verifying the dataset to ensure accuracy and consistency. This phase involved detecting and removing special characters, handling missing values, and eliminating duplicate entries in both English and Hindi titles. Our goal was to achieve a fully cleaned dataset, ready for further processing in upcoming phases.  

## Data Cleaning & Verification  

### 1. Special Character Removal  
- Conducted a thorough scan to identify and remove any unwanted special characters from the dataset.  
- Ensured that all titles contained only valid English and Hindi text.  

### 2. Handling Missing Values  
- Identified missing values in the **"Cleaned Hindi Title"** column.  
- Replaced missing values with appropriate placeholders to maintain data integrity.  

### 3. Duplicate Entry Removal  
- Found and removed duplicate records in both English and Hindi titles.  
- Ensured that each title appears only once in the cleaned dataset.  

## Final Dataset Verification  
After completing the cleaning process, we performed a final check to confirm:  

- [x] No missing values in any column.  
- [x] No duplicate English or Hindi titles.  
- [x] No special characters or formatting issues.  
- [x] Final dataset is fully cleaned and ready for use. âœ…  

## Summary of Week 2 Achievements  
- [x] Special characters removed.  
- [x] Missing values handled.  
- [x] Duplicate titles eliminated.  
- [x] Final dataset verified and confirmed clean.  

## Next Steps (Week 3 and Beyond)  
In the upcoming weeks, we plan to:  
- Implement advanced text normalization techniques.  
- Develop title similarity detection using **TF-IDF** and **Cosine Similarity**.  
- Build an **API and frontend interface** for the system.  
- Further refine the dataset based on domain-specific requirements.  

Week 2 has been a major step toward ensuring data quality, and weâ€™re excited to move forward with model development! ðŸš€  

## Final Verification & Results  
After multiple iterations, the dataset was validated against key quality checks:  

- [x] No missing values âœ…  
- [x] No duplicate Hindi titles âœ…  
- [x] No unwanted special characters âœ…  
- [x] Uniform formatting for all titles âœ…  

The final cleaned dataset was exported and is now ready for further processing in the **Title Verification System**.  

## Next Steps (Week 3 and Beyond)  
In the upcoming weeks, we aim to:  
- Implement **advanced text normalization techniques** to enhance accuracy.  
- Develop **similarity detection algorithms** using TF-IDF, Cosine Similarity, and phonetic matching.  
- Begin **integrating the cleaned dataset** into the verification system backend.  

With a fully cleaned and structured dataset, we are now well-prepared for the next phase of development! ðŸš€
